# ALOS K&C4
This is a repository of tools, resources, and outputs from the Philippines ALOS K&C4 Project, **Utilising L-Band SAR Data for Natural Resource Management in the Philippines.** For ALOS K&C Phase 4, we intended to utilise JAXA ’s earth observation products, particularly ALOS/PALSAR-2, ALOS/PALSAR, and JERS-1 SAR data, to demonstrate the utility and viability of L-band SAR for natural resources management applications in the Philippines. We proposed to utilise the data for the three thematic applications as follows: land cover change mapping and change detection; REDD+ and forest management; and mangrove forest mapping and change monitoring.

### Land Cover Change Mapping and Change Detection
The objective under this application is to assess the ability of spaceborne L-band SAR systems to support the generation of national baseline land cover and forest cover and change maps using a multi-level, hierarchical, land cover classification system. Specifically, I investigated the potential of combining L-band SAR with Landsat, an optical sensor, for mapping land cover and land change. 

### What is the ALOS Kyoto & Carbon Initiative?
Formed in 2001, the [ALOS Kyoto & Carbon Initiative](http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/kyoto/kyoto_index.htm) is an international science collaboration led and coordinated by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Earth Observation Research Centre. The ALOS K&C Initiative focuses primarily on defining and optimising provision of data products and validated thematic information derived from in-situ and satellite sensor data, particularly utilising JAXA’s [Advanced Land Observing Satellites](http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/about/about_index.htm) L-band synthetic aperture radar data: [ALOS/PALSAR](http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/about/palsar.htm) (2006-2011) and [ALOS-2/PALSAR-2](http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS-2/en/about/palsar2.htm) (2014 onwards). The main objective of the ALOS K&C Initiative is to define, develop, and validate thematic products derived primarily from ALOS data that can be used to meet the specific information requirements relating to International Conventions, Carbon Cycle Science, and Conservation of the Environment.

#### The Philippines K&C Projects
The Philippines became part of the K&C Initiative starting in Phase 3 (2011-2014), and subsequently in Phase 4 (2014-2018). Under a joint collaborative effort, the Philippines team is composed of representatives from Fauna & Flora International, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH, and the Department of Geodetic Engineering of the University of the Philippines. Please check the following links for [Phase 3](https://14n121e.wordpress.com/projects/kc-phase-3-2011-2014/) and [Phase 4](https://14n121e.wordpress.com/projects/kc-phase-4-2014-2018/) for more information on the Philippines K&C projects.
