# ALOS K&C4
This is a repository of tools, resources, and outputs from 


ALOS Kyoto &amp; Carbon Initiative project on land use/cover mapping and change detection using L-band SAR mosaic data.

## What is the ALOS Kyoto & Carbon Initiative?
Formed in 2001, the [ALOS Kyoto & Carbon Initiative](http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/kyoto/kyoto_index.htm) is an international science collaboration led and coordinated by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency Earth Observation Research Centre. The ALOS K&C Initiative focuses primarily on defining and optimising provision of data products and validated thematic information derived from in-situ and satellite sensor data, particularly utilising JAXA’s [Advanced Land Observing Satellites](http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/about/about_index.htm) L-band synthetic aperture radar data: [ALOS/PALSAR](http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/about/palsar.htm) (2006-2011) and [ALOS-2/PALSAR-2](http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS-2/en/about/palsar2.htm) (2014 onwards). The main objective of the ALOS K&C Initiative is to define, develop, and validate thematic products derived primarily from ALOS data that can be used to meet the specific information requirements relating to International Conventions, Carbon Cycle Science, and Conservation of the Environment.

### The Philippines K&C Projects
The Philippines became part of the K&C Initiative starting in Phase 3 (2011-2014), and subsequently in Phase 4 (2014-2018). Under a joint collaborative effort, the Philippines team is composed of representatives from Fauna & Flora International, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit GmbH, and the Department of Geodetic Engineering of the University of the Philippines. Please check the following links for [Phase 3](https://14n121e.wordpress.com/projects/kc-phase-3-2011-2014/) and [Phase 4](https://14n121e.wordpress.com/projects/kc-phase-4-2014-2018/) for more information on the Philippines K&C projects.
